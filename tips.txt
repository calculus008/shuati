String manipulation
1. Use an array of char[256], each element represent a ASCII char.
2. Sort an array to get easier search
3. Choose a data structure considering the feature of a collection
a. Array maintains the sequence of a list
b. Set keeps the uniqueness
c. Map has relationship with key value pair
4. Don't just think of 1 string. Sometimes adding string or double the string can simplify things. Such as the rotation quesion.

------------------------------
Tree
1. Difference between trees
2. Binary search tree - 
a. how to build one 
b. how to traverse - BFS, DFS

Linkedlist
1. Double LinkedList to have O(1) on removal. 

------------------------------
Recursion
1. Find the basic logic that can be recursed
2. Find the way to break out the recursion
3. Check the boundries

------------------------------
Graph
1. 3 ways of representing map
Edge lists
Adjacency metrics
Adjacency lists
2. Travers/sort graph
Topological sort -- sort by indegree 
BFS - during BFS, if there is more than 1 state or properties need to pass to next level, create a object to store them.

------------------------------
Timeline questions:
-- A series of event happen on a timeline
-- Find the relationship between the events
1. Sorting the events along the timeline
2. Maintain queues of the events

------------------------------
Sorting
1. Merge sort
2. Quick sort
3. Radix sort

------------------------------
Math
1. Be careful with double, float numbers. Better use BigDecimal to do the calculation so that the presition is preserved. 
2. When declare a new BigDecimal, use the constructor that takes String instead of the one takes double.
3. Slope = Delta(x)/Delta(y) but it is better to use string to represent. To do that, need use the Max dividend of the two. To find the GCD:
        public int generateGcd(int x, int y) {
            if (y == 0) return x;
            return generateGcd(y, x % y);
        }

------------------------------
Bit manipulation: 
	1. BigInteger has built in bit operation. It also is the biggest number in java can represent (64bits). 
	2. Shift left is *2(power of number of position shifted), shift right is /2(power of number of position shifted).
	3. Check whether a bit is set - AND(&) a number with that bit. This is also getting that particular bit
	4. Set a bit - OR(|) a number with that bit set.
	5. Unset a bit - AND(&) a number with only that bit unset. 
	6. Flip/toggle a bit - XOR(^) a number with that bit set 
	7. Bit right of the decimal point is - 1/2power(n) with n=1 the first bit after '.': 0.101 = 1*(1/2) + 0*(1/4) + 1*(1/8)
	8. Every 8 bits is a Byte. So int is 32 bits and 4 bytes. Binery form is 64 bits, Hex form is 8 bytes.
	9. 0 ^ num = num; num ^ num = 0
	10. n & (n-1) remove the lowest 1.

------------------------------
Singleton DP
1. Implementation:
	public class Singleton {
        // Private constructor. Prevents instantiation from other classes.
        private Singleton() { }
 
        /**
         * Initializes singleton.
         *
         * SingletonHolder is loaded on the first execution of Singleton.getInstance()
         * or the first access to SingletonHolder.INSTANCE, not before.
         */
        private static class SingletonHolder {
                private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();
        }
 
        public static Singleton getInstance() {
                return SingletonHolder.INSTANCE;
        }
	}

2. Why singlegton?
For logging. Cfg read, DB access for performance issue.
And for anything don't want to repeat doing - like loading a set of data at beginning of a class. 
Global access of set of data - but can use static class in this case.
Stateless class - a singleton class can be mocked for testing purpose. A static method can't.

------------------------------
Factory DP:
GoF patterns: Factory Method and Abstract Factory.
creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.
refers to the newly created object through a common interface
1. Implementation
a. Factory class that mask the constructor of concrete products. 
b. Register the products class so that adding new product does not require modify the factory class.
c. Registering product can go with reflection way or use abstract method in product abstract class so each concrete product class register itself.
 
2. When to use:
If you have many objects of the same base type and you manipulate them mostly casted to abstract types, then you need a factory

------------------------------
Stacks and Queues
both usually implement using linkedlist. 
Stacks - new item add at head, and pop at head
Queue - new item add at tail, and pop at head
  
------------------------------  
Unicode vs ASCII
Unicode is 16 bits - 2 bytes. Java is unicode
ASCII is 8 bits - 1 byte. The first 127 char in Java is same as ASCII.  

------------------------------
Deadlock
Coffman conditions for a deadlock to happen
1. Mutually exclusive
2. Hold and Wait
3. No preemption
4. Circular wait

------------------------------
Storage size
2pow(32) ~ 4 billion ---- this is number of unique integer 
2pow(31) ~ 2 billion ---- this is number of non-neg integer
1GB = 1000MB= 1024*1024KB=1024*1024*1024Byte ~ 1 billion
1 GB ~ 8 billion of bits
2pow(10) = 1024.
1GB = 2pow(10) * 2pow(10) * 2pow(10) * 8 bits = 2pow(30) * 2pow(3) = 2pow(33)

------------------------------
SQL
1. Use '' in the queries.

2. Basic commands
create table "tablename" ("column1" "data type" [constraint], "column2" "data type" [constraint], "column3" "data type" [constraint]);

insert into "tablename" (first_column,...last_column) values (first_value,...last_value);

update "tablename" set "columnname" = "newvalue" [,"nextcolumn" = "newvalue2"...] where "columnname" OPERATOR "value" [and|or "column" OPERATOR "value"];

delete from "tablename" where "columnname" OPERATOR "value" [and|or "column" OPERATOR "value"];

SELECT [ALL | DISTINCT] column1[,column2] FROM table1[,table2] [WHERE "conditions"] [GROUP BY "column-list"] [HAVING "conditions] [ORDER BY "column-list" [ASC | DESC] ];

3. Aggregate Funcs
MIN	returns the smallest value in a given column
MAX	returns the largest value in a given column
SUM	returns the sum of the numeric values in a given column
AVG	returns the average value of a given column
COUNT	returns the total number of values in a given column
COUNT(*)	returns the number of rows in a table

Aggregate funcs are required by GROUP BY clause.
If a column want to be selected correctly it has to be in GROUP BY as well.
HAVING requires GROUP BY

4. Other OPERATORs in Where clause
SELECT col1, SUM(col2) FROM "list-of-tables" WHERE col3 IN (list-of-values);
SELECT col1, SUM(col2) FROM "list-of-tables" WHERE col3 BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

5. Math Funcs
+	addition
-	subtraction
*	multiplication
/	division
%	modulo
ABS(x)	returns the absolute value of x
SIGN(x)	returns the sign of input x as -1, 0, or 1 (negative, zero, or positive respectively)
MOD(x,y)	modulo - returns the integer remainder of x divided by y (same as x%y)
FLOOR(x)	returns the largest integer value that is less than or equal to x
CEILING(x) or CEIL(x)	returns the smallest integer value that is greater than or equal to x
POWER(x,y)	returns the value of x raised to the power of y
ROUND(x)	returns the value of x rounded to the nearest whole integer
ROUND(x,d)	returns the value of x rounded to the number of decimal places specified by the value d
SQRT(x)	returns the square-root value of x

6. Joins
SELECT "list-of-columns" FROM table1,table2 WHERE "search-condition(s)";
Select "list-of-columns" FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON "search-condition";

------------------------------
Testing
1. Ask questions about
Who will use it, why
What are the use cases
Boundary of use
Stess and failure conditions
How to perform test

2. For software
manual or automated
black or white box

3. Proceed with test
Give a plan - prioritize, separate into functions/area, type of testing
Testing types:
	Functional
	Regression
	Load and performance - response time, throughput, resource utilization, max load
	Integration with other
	E2E/UAT
