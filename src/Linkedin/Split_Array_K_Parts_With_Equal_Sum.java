     *
     * Examples:
     *
     * Input : arr = [2, 1, 4, 5, 6], K = 3
     * Output : Yes
     * we can divide above array into 3 parts with equal

     * Input  : arr = [2, 1, 5, 5, 6], K = 3
     * Output : No
     * It is not possible to divide above array into 3
     * parts with equal sum
