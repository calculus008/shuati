     *
     * given a simple expression as string, evaluate the expression and return the result
     * These are the rules :
     * expression contains integers(can be negative) and '+','-','/','*' operators and no paranthesis
     * each operator and operand are sperated by exactly one space
     * assum the expression is valid
     * * and / have precedence over + and -
     * all operations are integer operations
     * you cant use eval function
     *
     * examples:
     * 1 * -2 + -3 * 4 return -14
     *
     * 1 + 135 / 134 return 2
     *
     * -234 should return -23
