Designing a system like Airflow involves understanding its core functionality: orchestrating workflows with directed
acyclic graphs (DAGs). Let’s break it down:

Key Components:
Scheduler: Responsible for triggering tasks in DAGs based on defined schedules or dependencies.

Solution: Use Cron-like scheduling for periodic jobs, and a dependency resolver to trigger tasks based on upstream
completions.
Workers: These execute the tasks.

Solution: Distributed worker architecture (e.g., Celery or Kubernetes) that can scale horizontally.
Task Queuing: When tasks are ready, they are queued for execution.

Solution: Use message brokers like RabbitMQ or Redis to distribute tasks across workers.
Task Execution: The actual running of individual tasks.

Solution: Utilize task executors (e.g., local, Celery, KubernetesExecutor) for running tasks in various environments.
Web Interface: A UI for monitoring, managing, and debugging DAGs and tasks.

Solution: Build a REST API that provides task states, logs, and DAG management, with a user-friendly front-end.
Metadata Database: Stores states of DAGs, tasks, and logs.

Solution: Use relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
DAG Definition: DAGs are Python-based, with nodes representing tasks and edges representing dependencies.

Solution: Use a declarative structure where users can define tasks and their dependencies programmatically.
Design Breakdown:
DAG Scheduler:

The scheduler scans DAG definitions, determines task readiness, and schedules tasks based on dependencies.
It manages workflows and ensures retries and error handling for tasks.
Worker Infrastructure:

Each task is assigned to a worker. Workers poll task queues and execute the tasks.
Workers can scale horizontally to handle more concurrent jobs.
Execution Backend:

Workers execute tasks, report their status back to the scheduler, and manage retries or failures.
The system needs a mechanism to ensure idempotency and task tracking.
Metadata and State Management:

States of tasks (success, failure, retry) need to be persisted for monitoring and restarting failed workflows.
The system can store logs, which are critical for debugging tasks.
Optimizations:
Task Caching: For repeated or expensive tasks, cache outputs to avoid recomputation.
Parallel Execution: Use multithreading or distributed computation to run independent tasks in parallel.
Dynamic DAG Generation: Support dynamically generated DAGs based on external inputs, such as API requests or events.
Technologies:
Scheduler: Python’s schedule library or a custom cron system.
Workers: Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ.
Execution Backend: Kubernetes for distributed scaling.
Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL for metadata storage.
API: Flask or FastAPI for the web interface.
This system design allows for efficient management, execution, and monitoring of complex workflows, similar to Apache
Airflow.
