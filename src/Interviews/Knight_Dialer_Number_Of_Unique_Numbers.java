     * How many unique, 7-digit numbers can a chess knight dial, starting from the 1?
     *
     * 1 2 3
     * 4 5 6
     * 7 8 9
     *   0
     *
     * For example, two such 7-digit numbers include:
     * 1 6 1 6 1 6 1
     * 1 6 0 4 3 8 3
     *
     * It is sometimes useful to begin with 3-digit numbers, as these can be explicitly enumerated:
     * - 161
     * - 167
     * - 160
     * - 181
     * - 183
     * Therefore, the answer is 5
