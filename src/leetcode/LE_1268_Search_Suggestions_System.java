    /**
     * Given an array of strings products and a string searchWord. We want to design
     * a system that suggests at most three product names from products after each
     * character of searchWord is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix
     * with the searchWord. If there are more than three products with a common prefix
     * return the three lexicographically minimums products.
     *
     * Return list of lists of the suggested products after each character of searchWord
     * is typed.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
     * Output: [
     * ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
     * ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
     * ["mouse","mousepad"],
     * ["mouse","mousepad"],
     * ["mouse","mousepad"]
     * ]
     * Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"]
     * After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"]
     * After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"]
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
     * Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
     *
     * Example 3:
     * Input: products = ["bags","baggage","banner","box","cloths"], searchWord = "bags"
     * Output: [["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags"],["bags"]]
     *
     * Example 4:
     * Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "tatiana"
     * Output: [[],[],[],[],[],[],[]]
     *
     * Constraints:
     * 1 <= products.length <= 1000
     * There are no repeated elements in products.
     * 1 <= Î£ products[i].length <= 2 * 10^4
     * All characters of products[i] are lower-case English letters.
     * 1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000
     * All characters of searchWord are lower-case English letters.

     *
     * Binary Search
     *
     * Intuition
     * In a sorted list of words, for any word A[i],
     * all its suggested words must following this word in the list.
     *
     * For example, if A[i] is a prefix of A[j],
     * A[i] must be the prefix of A[i + 1], A[i + 2], ..., A[j]
     *
     * Explanation
     * With this observation,
     * we can binary search the position of each prefix of search word,
     * and check if the next 3 words is a valid suggestion.
     *
     *
     * Complexity
     * Init : O(nlogn)
     * Query : O(len(searchWord)logn)
     *
     * Query is more expensive then Trie solution. Since we only need to search one searchWord, so
     * this solution avoids the high cost of init for Trie (we just need to do a sort here), so
     * even query is more expensive, it works faster overall.
