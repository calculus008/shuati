    /**
     * A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money.
     * For example, Alice paid for Bill's lunch for $10. Then later Chris gave
     * Alice $5 for a taxi ride. We can model each transaction as a tuple (x, y, z)
     * which means person x gave person y $z. Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are
     * person 0, 1, and 2 respectively (0, 1, 2 are the person's ID), the transactions
     * can be represented as [[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]].
     *
     * Given a list of transactions between a group of people, return the minimum
     * number of transactions required to settle the debt.
     *
     * Note:
     *
     * A transaction will be given as a tuple (x, y, z). Note that x â‰  y and z > 0.
     * Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 or we
     * could also have the persons 0, 2, 6.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input:
     * [[0,1,10], [2,0,5]]
     *
     * Output:
     * 2
     *
     * Explanation:
     * Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
     * Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
     *
     * Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays
     * person #0 and #2 $5 each.
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input:
     * [[0,1,10], [1,0,1], [1,2,5], [2,0,5]]
     *
     * Output:
     * 1
     *
     * Explanation:
     * Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
     * Person #1 gave person #0 $1.
     * Person #1 gave person #2 $5.
     * Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
     *
     * Therefore, person #1 only need to give person #0 $4, and all debt is settled.
