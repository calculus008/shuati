    /**
     * In a town, there are N people labelled from 1 to N.  There is a rumor that one of
     * these people is secretly the town judge.
     *
     * If the town judge exists, then:
     *
     * The town judge trusts nobody.
     * Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
     * There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
     * You are given trust, an array of pairs trust[i] = [a, b] representing that the person
     * labelled a trusts the person labelled b.
     *
     * If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the town judge.
     * Otherwise, return -1.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: N = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
     * Output: 2
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
     * Output: 3
     *
     * Example 3:
     * Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
     * Output: -1
     *
     * Example 4:
     * Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,2],[2,3]]
     * Output: -1
     *
     * Example 5:
     * Input: N = 4, trust = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[4,3]]
     * Output: 3
     *
     * Note:
     * 1 <= N <= 1000
     * trust.length <= 10000
     * trust[i] are all different
     * trust[i][0] != trust[i][1]
     * 1 <= trust[i][0], trust[i][1] <= N
     *
     * Easy

    /**
     * Same as LE_277_Find_The_Celebrity
     *
     * Convert to DAG issue, the target should have N - 1 in-degree and 0 out-degree.
     *
     * !!!
     * We can use two arrays to record in-degree and out-degree for each person, here
     * we simply use the property of town judge : in-degree - out-degree = N - 1, hence
     * we use only 1 array
     *
     * One optimization we can make is to observe that it is impossible for there to be a
     * town judge if there are not at least N - 1 edges in the trust array. This is because a
     * town judge must have N - 1 in-going edges, and so if there aren't at least N - 1 edges
     * in total, then it is impossible to meet this requirement.
     *
     * Time Complexity : O(E)
     * We loop over the trust list once. The cost of doing this is O(E)
     * We then loop over the people. The cost of doing this is O(N)
     *
     * Going by this, it now looks this is one those many graph problems where the cost is O(\max(N, E) = O(N + E).
     * After all, we don't know whether E or N is the bigger one, right?
     *
     * However, remember how we terminate early if E < N - 1? This means that in the best case, the time complexity
     * is O(1). And in the worst case, we know that E â‰¥ N - 1. For the purpose of big-oh notation, we ignore the
     * constant of 1. Therefore, in the worst case, E has to be bigger, and so we can simply drop the N,
     * leaving O(E).
     *
     * Space Complexity : O(N).
