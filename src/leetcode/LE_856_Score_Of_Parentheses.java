    /**
     * Given a balanced parentheses string S, compute the score of the string based on the following rule:
     *
     * () has score 1
     * AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
     * (A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.
     *
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: "()"
     * Output: 1
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: "(())"
     * Output: 2
     *
     * Example 3:
     * Input: "()()"
     * Output: 2
     *
     * Example 4:
     * Input: "(()(()))"
     * Output: 6
     *
     * Note:
     * S is a balanced parentheses string, containing only ( and ).
     * 2 <= S.length <= 50

     * It just occurs to me the input can be treated as a tree. Every () is a tree node. ()() can be treated as two
     * sibling nodes while (()) can be treated as a parent and a child node. Each leaf node has value 1 while non-leaf
     * node has double the value of all of its direct children's value. All we have to do is to calculate the root node
     * value via post-order traverse. And this is exactly what the approach 1 did as it always get the value of deeper
     * layers before gets its' own value! For example, the S = '(()(()()))' can be treated as the tree below.
     *
     *                             (10)            layer 0
     *                             Ôºè \
     *                           (1)  (4)          layer 1
     *                                /  \
     *                              (1)  (1)       layer 2
     *
     * Basically, the approach 2 is using the same idea. As you can see, the value of the root node is the sum of each
     * leaf node value to the power of it's depth. There are three leaf nodes in the tree. One leaf in layer 1 and two
     * leafs in layer 2. So the final answer is 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 10.
