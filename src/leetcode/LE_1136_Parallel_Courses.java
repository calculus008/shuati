     * You are given an integer n which indicates that we have n courses, labeled from 1 to n. You are also given an
     * array relations where relations[i] = [a, b], representing a prerequisite relationship between course a and
     * course b: course a has to be studied before course b.
     *
     * In one semester, you can study any number of courses as long as you have studied all the prerequisites for the
     * course you are studying.
     *
     * Return the minimum number of semesters needed to study all courses. If there is no way to study all the courses,
     * return -1.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]]
     * Output: 2
     * Explanation: In the first semester, courses 1 and 2 are studied. In the second semester, course 3 is studied.
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
     * Output: -1
     * Explanation: No course can be studied because they depend on each other.
     *
     * Constraints:
     * 1 <= n <= 5000
     * 1 <= relations.length <= 5000
     * 1 <= a, b <= n
     * a != b
     * All the pairs [a, b] are unique.
